                <p class="mt-3">Gas station cashier Davina must take desperate measures when an alien conspiracy theory starts wreaking havoc in her small town. As a practicing hypochondriac and an adulterous born-again Christian, Davina entertains a few delusions of her own. But she can only watch incredulously and argue fruitlessly as the strongest person she knows, her foster mother, starts painting over windows and drinking piss.</p>
                <p class="mt-5">With her relationships with her foster mother, foster sister, and (secret) boyfriend all hanging in the balance, Davina resolves to track down the mastermind behind the mysterious posts… and then must decide what to do with the culprit.</p>
